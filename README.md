Getting more practice with creating a custom Wordpress plugin. The Students Lister plugin lists the students in the class.

## Features
* Adds an array of students to a MySQL database using $wpdb
* Queries the database to get the names of the students using $wpdb
* Sorts the students by name using get_object_vars and strcasecmp functions in PHP
* Prints the sorted list of students to the front page using JavaScript
